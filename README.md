# introduction

## The Bechdel test’s history

In audiovisual works, there are marked inequalities and discrimination.
For instance in cinema industry, there is an underrepresentation of
women. Indeed, for each woman per film, there are 3 male characters
(Micic 2015). It influences the stereotype that considers women as not
important or invisible because the media are involved in the
construction of the social word on gender (Micic 2015). Because of this
issue, test like the Bechdel test has been created. Created by Alison
Bechdel in 1985, The test Bechdel is defined in this way :

> > > «The Bechdel Test gives films a pass or fail rating based on three
> > > linked criteria: “One, it has to have at least two women in it
> > > who, two, talk to each other about, three, something besides a
> > > man.” » (Selisker 2015, 505)

The goal is to represent the silence suffered by women by observing
their presence in movies (“What ‘The Bechdel Test’ Doesn’t Tell Us:
Examining Women’s Verbal and Vocal (Dis)empowerment in Cinema” n.d.). It
is a known test that has been used since 2013 in Swedish cinemas with
the ratings of the others (Selisker 2015). However, there is a big
controversy on this test since the first intention was not to produce a
serious model, but more a part of a story in a comic “the Rule” (1965)
(“What ‘The Bechdel Test’ Doesn’t Tell Us: Examining Women’s Verbal and
Vocal (Dis)empowerment in Cinema” n.d.). For this reason, it is not
exhaustive and it misses important sexist acts. On one hand, it does not
take into account beauty standards and hypersexualization. It also
misses the intersectional discrimination that creates a hierarchy on the
representation of women (“What ‘The Bechdel Test’ Doesn’t Tell Us:
Examining Women’s Verbal and Vocal (Dis)empowerment in Cinema” n.d.). On
another hand, the Bechdel test is not enough precise in its criteria.
For the third condition (talk about something else than a man) it is
important to know what the women talk about, why, where, and when
(Lakhotia, Nagesh, and Madgula 2019). Indeed, because of different
stereotypes, a discussion of two women can also reflect sexism even if
it is not about a man (“What ‘The Bechdel Test’ Doesn’t Tell Us:
Examining Women’s Verbal and Vocal (Dis)empowerment in Cinema” n.d.). To
see a synthesis of the positive effect and missed criteria of this test,
you can check this article : [“What ‘The Bechdel Test’ Doesn’t Tell Us:
Examining Women’s Verbal and Vocal (Dis)empowerment in Cinema”
(n.d.)](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1834&context=honorstheses)

However, even with these objections, the movies that pass the Bechdel
test seem to have a different effect than the ones that did not pass. In
the content of films, it seems to, in comparison to movies that did not
pass the test, the ones that pass are more centrally connected women.
(Agarwal et al. 2015). It seems also to have a practical effect on
social media. The trailers that did not seem to pass the Bechdel test
seem more popular, but the female users share more of the ones that pass
the Bechdel test. One of the reasons could be either fiction influencing
behavior and gender bias or the contrary or a combination of both
(Garcia, Weber, and Garimella 2014) Whatever the right mechanism,
reality, and fiction seem to be related, and evidence can be found on
both sides. For this reason, it would be still relevant to study
artworks through the Bechdel rule.

### Impact of the title of movies

The title is one of the things that are visible to the spectator before
they see the film. Even if what advantages a movie is often the fame of
the director and cast that goes with a big budget, the title of the
movie is also a way to make the movie more interesting. Indeed, their
effect has been studied, and an informative title would have more impact
in the first weeks of release (Bae and Kim 2019). So, this could imply
that title of the movie reflected a part of the content. Nevertheless,
The research on the impact of the movie’s title is still low (Bae and
Kim 2019). Studies about the Bechdel movie’s title do not does not
contradict.this observation. For this reason, I cannot precise my
assumption about the impact of the title of Bechdel movies and my study
will be only descriptive.

## Gender stereotype in sentiment

Gender stereotypes can be understood through the social role Theory
which is the idea that the inequality of gender is shaped by their roles
in society. For this reason, « Media most often represent boys and men
as active, adventurous, powerful, sexually aggressive, and largely
uninvolved in human relationships, and represent girls and women as
young, thin, beautiful, passive, dependent, and often incompetent »
(Micic 2015, 21). On this way, on one hand, sentiments are also related
to gender stereotypes (Bhaskaran and Bhallamudi 2019). For example, in
politics, the moral and behavioral, and physical aspects have stronger
negative sentiments on online news outlets than men (Brugnoli, Simone,
and Delmastro 2022). The importance of emotion does not perceive the
same between gender. Indeed, women seem to be emotional while men would
be rational (Garcia, Weber, and Garimella 2014). It is observed in
scientific talks like TED Talks where the comment was more personal and
emotional when the presenter was a woman (Amarasekara and Grant 2019).
On the other hand, some specific emotions would be more “male” and some
would be more “female”. For example, we predict that men will be more
angry, scared, and sad and women having more positive emotions
(Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2018). Gender bias seems also to avoid some
emotion depending on gender: for example, Women seems less show less
anger than men because it would be discredited them (Breen and Barreto
n.d.).

## Purpose of my research

Through this information about the Bechdel test, the title of the movie,
and sentiment discriminated through gender, my question of the research
is “Does the result of the Bechdel test have an impact on the presence
of sentiment on the title of the movie ?” As the movie that passes the
Bechdel test is assumed to represent women better, it could include more
female aspect stereotypes in opposite to the films that did not pass
where male aspect stereotypes would be more present. Since the title of
the movie can be informative, hypnotically, it could be influenced by
the importance of the female character for the ones that pass the
Bechdel test. As it was observed, some sentiments can be more present
with movies that did not pass the test and others more present with the
ones that passed it. The null hypothesis is there is no significant
difference between the mean of sentiment between the movie that did not
pass the Bechdel test and the ones that pass it. The alternative
hypothesis is there is a significant difference between the mean of
sentiment between the movie that did not pass the Bechdel test and the
ones that pass it. My prediction is that the alternative hypothesis will
be accepted.

# method

## collecting data

The dataset is from the website
[bechdeltest.com](https://bechdeltest.com/). It is still active and news
films continue to be added. When I use this data set, it contained 9630
movies from 1874 to 2022. The rating assignment is made by the visitors.
It is possible to contest the rates and a webmaster will be updated by
sets flag. So the limitation of this data set is the subjectivity of the
rater even the continuous feedback since the way everyone rates can be
different since some movies can be ambiguous. However, the research
tries to resolve it by creating an automatic Bechdel test see [Lakhotia,
Nagesh, and Madgula
(2019)](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1907/1907.03702.pdf)

## modeling data

I use some r packages:

-   ggplot2
-   dplyr
-   tidyverse
-   tada.table
-   dtidytext

For my study, I used the lexical approach which identifies the sentiment
of a word by building a lexicon (a dictionary of sentiment) and mapping
words to it.

There are several kinds of sentimental lexicon. The one I used for this
experiment is
[nrc](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/products-services/technical-advisory-services/sentiment-emotion-lexicons).

I did two tests. For both of them, I had to modify my data table. I
selected the column of titles according to their rank on the Bechdel
test. Then I used the unnest_tockens() function to differentiate each
word from the titles so that I could analyse each word separately. Then
I used the inner_join() function to take only the words. Indeed, if I
hadn’t done this, as the words follow the \[tac\] rule, there would be
words with no sentimental meaning like “of” or “the” which would have
made the results confusing. After modelling my data table, my first step
is to compare the frequency of words between the film titles that passed
the bechdel test and the others. I separated the ones that didn’t pass
the test into 3 rankings “0”, maximum 1 woman, “1”, two women but not
talking, “2”, two women talking but only men. So I counted the number of
words per rating, then I made the proportion for each of them. Finally,
I did a correlation test to check the observable finding on the graph.
For the second experiment, I wanted to analyse precisely which feelings
were involved in the different levels of the bechdel test result. I
therefore used the same group separation as for my first test. This time
I used the summarize() function, grouping the different words by
sentiment to find out how many words use a certain sentiment.

# result

For the frequency experimentation :

Pearson’s product-moment correlation

Comparaison between rating “0” and pass : t = 14.258, df = 222, p-value
\< 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95
percent confidence interval: 0.6161450 0.7541245 sample estimates: cor
0.6913872

Comparaison between rating “1” and pass : t = 17.8, df = 324, p-value \<
2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95
percent confidence interval: 0.6436841 0.7541674 sample estimates: cor
0.7031451

Comparaison between rating “2” and pass : t = 12.738, df = 204, p-value
\< 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95
percent confidence interval: 0.5818459 0.7353939 sample estimates: cor
0.6656055

The plot’s code is from the website
[tidytextmining.com](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html)

The shape of this graph does not show much difference in the
distribution of words. With the statsitcs result of the correlations
between the levels, we see that the difference is small. The word
frequencies seem to differ more with level “2” with 0.6656055 than with
level “0” 0.6913872 and level “3” with a correlation of 0.7031451.

The plot’s code is from the website

![](Bechler_report_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)![](Bechler_report_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png)
With this graph, we observe that there is little difference in the
feelings between the different ratings of the test. For the “0” rating,
we observe that there are more negative than positive words compared to
the other groups. Otherwise, for all groups, it seems that the strongest
feeling is fear.

# Discussion

## conclusion

With these two tests, we therefore notice that there does not seem to be
any significant differences between the feelings found in the titles of
the films that pass the Bechdel test and those that do not. This does
not contradict the results of the previously cited articles, as none of
them provided a clear prediction on my research question.

## Limitation

### State of art

I do not find precise information about the subject of sentiment
analysis for the title of movies that were tested to the Bechdel test.
So, I directed my study with numerous typical assumptions.

### Data set

It is a big generalization because the movies are also constructed
differently depending on the budget. For example, with low promotional
budgets having an informative title is important (Bae & Kim, 2019). but
not for a blockbuster my analysis was only focused on the factor of
rating in the Bechdel test.

### nrc package

There are several lexicons of feeling and constructed in different ways.
For example, some lexicons will focus on putting scales between negative
and positive instead of defining a feeling. Others will use other
feelings and even those that use the same classification are not
necessarily the same. Indeed, the ratio of words that can be defined
positively and words that can be defined negatively and other elements
of the classification, can be different and therefore we do not get the
same results depending on which one is used

### further direction

It would be interesting to observe if there is more sentiment words in
bechdel test since the stereotype is also woman are consider as more
emotional.
