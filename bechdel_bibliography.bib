We present a computational extension of the Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias, by looking for two female characters who discuss about something besides a man. We provide the tools to quantify Bechdel scores for both genders, and we measure them in movie scripts and large datasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies and users of social media, we ﬁnd that movies and Twitter conversations have a consistent male bias, which does not appear when analyzing MySpace. Furthermore, the narrative of Twitter is closer to the movies that do not pass the Bechdel test than to those that pass it.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the Bechdel Test and its accuracy in measuring the progressiveness of films. The Bechdel Test is a set of parameters that are used to measure a film’s representation of women; for a film to pass the Bechdel Test, two named women must talk to each other about something other than a man. In the United States, 40\% of films still fail this test. The representation of women in film, especially teenage girls, creates a negative stereotype; it shows that they are aggressive and only care about their male love interests. The experiment in this paper compares two different movie scenes, one passing the test and one not, to measure whether perceived progressiveness, acceptability, portrayal of sex in media, sex roles, and which sex wrote the movie differ in either of the scenes. The scenes come from two different teen romance movies, both Netflix Originals. The paper critiques the Bechdel Test and the creation of new tests to show the disparity of gender in movies.},

	abstract = {A lot has been said and discussed regarding the rationale and significance of the Bechdel Score. It became a digital sensation in 2013 when Swedish cinemas began to showcase the Bechdel test score of a film alongside its rating. The test has drawn criticism from experts and the film fraternity regarding its use to rate the female presence in a movie. The pundits believe that the score is too simplified and the underlying criteria of a film to pass the test must include 1) at least two women, 2) who have at least one dialogue, 3) about something other than a man, is egregious. In this research, we have considered a few more parameters which highlight how we represent females in film, like the number of female dialogues in a movie, dialogue genre, and part of speech tags in the dialogue. The parameters were missing in the existing criteria to calculate the Bechdel score. The research aims to analyze 342 movies scripts to test a hypothesis if these extra parameters, above with the current Bechdel criteria, are significant in calculating the female representation score. The result of the Principal Component Analysis method concludes that the female dialogue content is a key component and should be considered while measuring the representation of women in a work of fiction.},

Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders. We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 'Affect in Tweets'. We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender.

To help understand potential causes of this gap, analysis was conducted on popularity indicators and audience sentiments of 450 videos from 90 Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics?related channels. Female hosted channels were found to accumulate more comments per view, and significantly higher proportions of appearance, hostile, critical/negative and sexist/sexual commentary.},

	abstract = {The media attention to the personal sphere of famous and important individuals has become a key element of the gender narrative. Here we combine lexical, syntactic and sentiment analysis to investigate the role of gender in the personalization of a wide range of political office holders in Italy during the period 2017-2020. On the basis of a score for words that is introduced to account for gender unbalance in both representative and news coverage, we show that the political personalization in Italy is more detrimental for women than men, with the persistence of entrenched stereotypes including a masculine connotation of leadership, the resulting women's unsuitability to hold political functions, and a greater deal of focus on their attractiveness and body parts. In addition, women politicians are covered with a more negative tone than their men counterpart when personal details are reported. Further, the major contribution to the observed gender differences comes from online news rather than print news, suggesting that the expression of certain stereotypes may be better conveyed when click baiting and personal targeting have a major impact.},

However, the movie title is one of the relatively inexpensive production factors that a studio can use to its advantage. This study examines how an informative movie title, that is, a movie title that contains information about its genre or storyline, affects a movie's box office revenue. This study used an analysis of a 5-year period in the South Korean movie market to show that an informative movie title has a positive impact on box office revenue for an under-promoted movie, where prerelease promotional activities are measured by the volume of prerelease media exposure. However, this impact decreases as prerelease promotional activities increase. This mechanism not only contributes to the understanding of the film industry, but also to the literature on the entertainment industry and brand and firm names.},
